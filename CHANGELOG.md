## [Unreleased]

## [1.0.2] - 2026-06-20

### Added
- Mission audit now discovers nested worktree archive sessions, surfaces missing scoring evidence, and reports specialist invocation gaps.
- Slow-session reports now include a separate phase-duration observability breakdown.

### Fixed
- Audit deduplication now prefers completed pass/done records over stale halt copies for the same logical mission run.

## [1.0.1] - 2026-06-17

### Added
- **Q11 – stagnation auto-count**: `push-score` now increments `stagnation_count` automatically when the composite improvement (`cur − prev`) is in the range `[0, 0.1)`. Regression (score drop) and first-push are treated as non-stagnation and reset the counter to 0.
- **S3 – duplicate issue-ref warning**: `init` gains an `--issue-ref <ref>` option. When another active session for the same project already carries the same `issue_ref`, a `WARNING [S3]` is printed to stderr (non-blocking). Self-detection on resume (same `session_id`) is excluded.

### Fixed
- **Q11 regression fix**: negative delta (score regression) was incorrectly treated as stagnation. Condition tightened to `0 <= delta < 0.1` using `_is_valid_composite()` for type safety.
- Synced the copied Codex marketplace wrapper (`plugins/mission/`) with the canonical `skills/` and `scripts/` trees so it includes the latest stale auto-halt, High-gate, stats, and scoring-rubric fixes.
- Added a regression test that fails when the Codex wrapper drifts from the canonical implementation.

## [1.0.0] - 2026-06-15

First public release.

### Added
- Mission orchestrator skill and five supporting skills (planner, executor, reviewer, critic, scorer).
- `.mission-state` session-state CLI (`mission-state.py`) with multi-session isolation for Claude Code and Codex.
- Threshold-gated completion with score history and review/critic loops.
- Stop hook that blocks premature completion while a mission is active. Stale-state timestamp parsing is portable across macOS (BSD `date`) and Linux (GNU `date`).
- Claude Code plugin metadata and a local plugin marketplace manifest.
- Codex plugin packaging (`plugins/mission/`) and skill symlink guidance, with an opt-in Stop hook.
- Python test suite covering state routing, scoring gates, and hook behavior.
- GitHub Actions CI (`push`, `pull_request`, `workflow_dispatch`) with pytest and ShellCheck.
